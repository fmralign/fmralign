Current individualized models of brain functional organization are based on brain regions and networks, limiting their use in studying fine-grained vertex-level differences. In this work, we present the individualized neural tuning (INT) model, a fine-grained individualized model of brain functional organization. The INT model is designed to have vertex-level granularity, to capture both representational and topographic differences, and to model stimulus-general neural tuning. Through a series of analyses, we demonstrate that (a) our INT model provides a reliable individualized measure of fine-grained brain functional organization, (b) it accurately predicts individualized brain response patterns to new stimuli, and (c) for many benchmarks, it requires only 10–20 minutes of data for good performance. The high reliability, specificity, precision, and generalizability of our INT model affords new opportunities for building brain-based biomarkers based on naturalistic neuroimaging paradigms.}",

	abstract = {The functional architecture of the object vision pathway in the human brain was investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure patterns of response in ventral temporal cortex while subjects viewed faces, cats, five categories of man-made objects, and nonsense pictures. A distinct pattern of response was found for each stimulus category. The distinctiveness of the response to a given category was not due simply to the regions that responded maximally to that category, because the category being viewed also could be identified on the basis of the pattern of response when those regions were excluded from the analysis. Patterns of response that discriminated among all categories were found even within cortical regions that responded maximally to only one category. These results indicate that the representations of faces and objects in ventral temporal cortex are widely distributed and overlapping.},
